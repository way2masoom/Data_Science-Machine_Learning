## **For Windows**

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**  
   Run the following command in your terminal:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**  
   Navigate to the `Scripts` folder inside your environment and activate it:  
   ```bash
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Once activated, you can start installing dependencies for your project.

## **For Linux or macOS**

1. **Install Virtualenv:**  
   Ensure `virtualenv` is installed by running:  
   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**  
   Use the following command to create a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   virtualenv -p python3 virtual_env
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**  
   Activate the environment using the command:
